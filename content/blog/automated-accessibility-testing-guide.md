However, there are technical challenges involved in building these tools, and there is a lack of developer knowledge regarding automated accessibility testing. Therefore, it's essential to recognise the limitations of automated testing and supplement it with manual testing to ensure that websites and applications are inclusive and accessible to all users.

### Types of automated accessibility testing

There are several types of automated accessibility testing that businesses can use to ensure that their websites and applications are accessible to users with disabilities. Some examples include: Static Analysis: This type of testing involves analysing the code and content of web pages to identify accessibility issues. Static analysis tools can identify problems like missing alt text for images, incorrect heading structure, and missing form labels.

Dynamic Analysis: This type of testing involves analysing the behaviour of web pages to identify accessibility issues. Dynamic analysis tools can identify issues like keyboard accessibility, focus management, and colour contrast.

Hybrid Analysis: This type of testing combines static and dynamic analysis to provide a more comprehensive assessment of web page accessibility. Hybrid analysis tools can identify a wide range of accessibility issues, including those that are difficult to locate using either static or dynamic analysis alone.

Visual Regression Testing: This type of testing involves comparing screenshots of web pages over time to identify changes that may impact accessibility. Visual regression testing tools can help businesses to ensure that changes to their websites and applications do not negatively impact accessibility.

By using a combination of these automated accessibility testing tools, businesses can ensure that their websites and applications are accessible to users with disabilities. It's important to note that no single agency or approach can provide a complete assessment of accessibility, and manual testing is also necessary to supplement automated testing.

### Benefits of Automated Accessibility Testing

Automated accessibility testing can benefit businesses and organisations of all sizes. By identifying potential accessibility issues automatically, these tools can help businesses to save time and resources while ensuring that their websites and applications are accessible to users with disabilities.

In this section, we will explore the benefits of automated accessibility testing in more detail, including how it can improve user experience, reduce legal risks, and enhance brand reputation. We will also discuss how automated accessibility testing can help businesses to meet accessibility standards and guidelines and provide a more inclusive experience for all users.

Automated testing tools can also help to identify accessibility issues that may be difficult or impossible to detect manually, such as issues related to colour contrast, keyboard accessibility, and ARIA attributes. These tools can also see problems that may be difficult to reproduce consistently, such as issues related to screen-reader compatibility or assistive technology.

For example, an automated accessibility testing tool could identify a low-contrast button on a web page that may be difficult for users with visual impairments to see. In contrast, a manual tester may not have noticed this issue, mainly if they were not explicitly looking for it. In addition, automated testing tools can provide more consistent and repeatable results than manual testing, as they use a standardised set of rules and guidelines to test for accessibility. This can help to ensure that accessibility issues are identified and addressed consistently across all pages and components of a website or application.

Overall, the better coverage aspect of automated accessibility testing can help businesses to identify a broader range of accessibility issues, including those that may be difficult or impossible to detect manually. By using automated testing tools, companies can ensure that their websites and applications are accessible to users with disabilities, providing a more inclusive experience for all users.

### Consistency and accuracy

Automated accessibility testing also offers the benefits of consistency and accuracy. When using manual testing methods, accessibility issues can be missed due to human error, bias, or simply because a tester may not know all the accessibility requirements. Automated testing tools, on the other hand, use a standardised set of rules and guidelines to test for accessibility, which helps to ensure that accessibility issues are identified and addressed consistently across all pages and components of a website or application.

Automated testing tools can also provide more accurate results than manual testing, as they are less prone to human error or oversight. These tools can scan large volumes of code and detect accessibility issues quickly and accurately, reducing the risk of missing important points. In addition, automated testing tools can provide detailed reports that include specific problems, recommendations for remediation, and even code snippets to help developers fix the issues. For example, an automated accessibility testing tool could identify a missing alt tag on an image, which is essential for users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers. In contrast, a manual tester may have overlooked this issue or missed it due to a mistake or oversight.

Overall, the consistency and accuracy of automated accessibility testing can help businesses to ensure that their websites and applications are fully accessible to users with disabilities. By using automated testing tools, companies can identify and address accessibility issues quickly and accurately, improving the user experience for all users.

### Challenges of Automated Accessibility Testing

While there are many benefits to automated accessibility testing, there are also some challenges that businesses may face when implementing these tools. In the next chapter, we will explore some of the key challenges of automated accessibility testing and discuss strategies for addressing these challenges to ensure that businesses can fully realise the benefits of these tools.

### False positives

False positives occur when a computerised testing tool incorrectly identifies an element as inaccessible, even though it complies with accessibility guidelines. This can lead to wasted time and resources, as developers may spend time fixing issues that do not exist.

While most accessibility scanners are considered reliable and effective automated testing tools, they have been known to flag elements as inaccessible even when they comply with accessibility guidelines. For example, many tools may flag a link as having insufficient contrast, even when the link's contrast ratio meets WCAG guidelines.

To address the issue of false positives, businesses should take steps to verify the results of automated testing tools and should not rely solely on the output of these tools. This may involve manually reviewing elements that have been flagged as inaccessible to determine whether the issues are valid or not. In addition, businesses should work with their development teams to ensure that developers understand how to interpret the output of automated testing tools and can distinguish between valid accessibility issues and false positives.

Overall, while false positives can be a challenge when using automated accessibility testing tools, businesses can take steps to address this issue and ensure that these tools effectively identify and address accessibility issues. By combining automatic and manual testing methods, companies can ensure that their websites and applications are fully accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities.

### Lack of human judgement

While automated testing tools are effective at identifying many types of accessibility issues, they cannot replicate the nuanced judgement and experience of a human tester. For example, an automated testing tool may flag a page as inaccessible because of a missing alt tag on an image but may not be able to determine whether the alt tag accurately describes the image's content in a meaningful way to users with disabilities.

On the other hand, human testers can apply their judgement and experience to identify issues that may be more difficult to detect using automated testing tools. For example, a human tester may be able to identify problems related to the language used on a website or may be able to identify issues related to the overall flow and usability of a website.

To address the challenge of the lack of human judgement in automated accessibility testing, businesses should consider combining automated and manual testing methods. While automated testing tools can help to identify many types of accessibility issues quickly and efficiently, manual testing can help to identify more nuanced issues that may be missed by automated means. In addition, businesses should ensure that their development teams are knowledgeable about accessibility best practices and can apply their own judgement and experience to identify and address accessibility issues. By working with both automated and manual testing tools, businesses can ensure that their websites and applications are fully accessible to users with disabilities.

### Technical limitations

Another challenge of automated accessibility testing is the technical limitations of these tools. While automated testing tools are effective at identifying many types of accessibility issues, they may not be able to detect all kinds of problems. For example, automated testing tools may not be able to detect issues related to the content's context, such as the readability of text within a particular design or layout.

In addition, automated testing tools may not be able to detect issues related to the dynamic nature of web content. For example, an automated testing tool may not be able to find changes to a website's content that occur in response to user interactions, such as pop-up windows or drop-down menus.

To address the challenge of technical limitations in automated accessibility testing, businesses should work with their development teams to ensure that their websites and applications are designed and developed in a way that is accessible by default. This may involve using accessible design patterns, following best practices for semantic markup, and ensuring that all content is presented clearly and understandably.

In addition, businesses should consider using automated and manual testing methods to ensure their websites and applications are fully accessible. This may involve using automated testing tools to identify and address common accessibility issues quickly and efficiently while also performing manual testing to identify more nuanced issues that may be missed by automated means.

Overall, while automated accessibility testing tools can be effective at identifying many types of accessibility issues, businesses should be aware of the technical limitations of these tools and should take steps to address these limitations through a combination of automated and manual testing methods.
