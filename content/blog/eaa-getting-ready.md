## What Businesses Need to Know and How to Prepare for 2025

As a consultant and Saas founder, I can confidently say that the [European Accessibility Act (EAA)][2] represents a significant shift in the digital landscape.

It's not just another regulation; it's a transformative mandate that will reshape how businesses approach digital products.

The EAA is a game-changer for several reasons:

1.  It extends accessibility requirements to the private sector, complementing existing legislation like the EU Web Accessibility Directive.
2.  It harmonizes accessibility standards across the EU, creating a more unified market for accessible products and services.
3.  It covers a broad range of digital products and services, from e-commerce platforms to smartphones and e-books.

## Key Implications for Businesses

My advise to businesses is to focus on the following areas:

1.  **Comprehensive Audits**: Conduct thorough accessibility audits of your digital assets, including websites, mobile apps, and self-service terminals.
2.  **POUR Principles**: Align your accessibility strategy with the POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) which form the foundation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
3.  **Cross-border Considerations**: For businesses operating in multiple EU countries, pay special attention to language and localization aspects of accessibility.

## Preparing for 2025

The June 28, 2025 enforcement date may seem distant, but in my experience, businesses often underestimate the time and resources required for full compliance. Here's what I recommend:

1.  Start early: Begin your accessibility journey now to avoid last-minute scrambles.
2.  Develop a roadmap: Create a detailed plan for achieving compliance, including milestones and resource allocation.
3.  Train your team: Invest in accessibility training for your staff, especially developers and content creators.
4.  Choose the right tools: Utilize accessibility testing tools and platforms to streamline your compliance efforts.

### Potential Challenges and Solutions

In my consultancy work, I've observed several common challenges:

**Legacy Systems**: Older systems may require significant updates or replacements to meet accessibility standards.

**Solution**: Prioritize updates based on user impact and compliance requirements.

**Resource Constraints**: Smaller businesses may struggle with the resources needed for compliance.

**Solution**: Explore exemptions for micro-enterprises and focus on gradual, prioritized improvements.

**Ongoing Maintenance**: Accessibility is not a one-time fix but requires continuous attention.

**Solution**: Integrate accessibility checks into your regular development and content creation processes.

### The Role of Accessibility Tools

Tools like Sitefig can be invaluable in your accessibility journey. They can help you:

1.  Identify accessibility issues across your digital properties.
2.  Prioritize fixes based on impact and compliance requirements.
3.  Monitor ongoing compliance and track progress over time.

If you have a significant number of websites and applications, you will have to start with automated testing. Preferably, you will use a tool that can identify which pages need manual auditing and can monitor your progress over time.

## Why Should Businesses Care About the European Accessibility Act?

1.  **Legal Obligations and Consequences**

The European Accessibility Act, officially adopted in 2019, becomes enforceable on June 28, 2025.

From this date, businesses offering services or products in the EU must comply with stringent accessibility requirements. Failure to do so can lead to fines, legal actions, and exclusion from public procurement processes. Penalties for non-compliance vary by country but can reach up to millions of euros depending on the breach's severity and the business's size.

2.  **Inclusion and Market Expansion**

Adhering to the EAA is not just about avoiding penalties; it's about embracing inclusivity. According to [Eurostat, over 27% of the EU population has some form of disability][10]. Ignoring accessibility means limiting your potential market and alienating a significant portion of your audience. By complying with the EAA, you'll open your products and services to more customers, including those with disabilities, temporary impairments, or situational needs.

3**Competitive Edge and Innovation**

Accessibility can drive innovation. The challenge of designing products and services for all users often leads to new, creative solutions that improve usability for everyone. Businesses that prioritize accessibility from the start will likely stay ahead of competitors, enhance their reputation, and build customer trust.

### What is the European Accessibility Act?

The European Accessibility Act (EAA) is a directive to ensure that products and services across the EU are accessible to individuals with disabilities. The EAA applies to various sectors, including digital and physical services, from e-commerce websites to ATMs, ticketing machines, and mobile apps. It harmonizes accessibility standards across EU member states and eliminates barriers from differing national laws.

Under the EAA, businesses operating in e-commerce, banking, transport, and telecommunications industries must ensure that their digital products, services, and content meet accessibility requirements. The act mandates the integration of accessibility from the design phase, ensuring that products and services are accessible to people with varying disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.

### What Businesses Need to Do to Comply

1.  **Identify if the EAA Applies to You**

If your company provides services or products within the EU, the EAA likely applies to you. The act targets public and private entities, focusing on key industries like telecommunications, financial services, transport, e-commerce, and digital media. Companies outside the EU offering services or products to EU consumers must also comply.

1.  **Understand What Needs to Be Accessible**

The EAA mandates accessibility for a wide range of products and services, including:

1.  **Websites and mobile apps**: All digital interfaces, from e-commerce platforms to mobile banking apps, must be fully accessible.
2.  **Hardware and software**: Devices such as computers, smartphones, and ATMs must be operable by people with disabilities.
3.  **E-books and media streaming services**: Audiovisual content and e-readers must offer features like subtitles, audio descriptions, and screen-reader compatibility.

Businesses must ensure their websites and apps are **perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust** per the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA, the minimum standard for accessibility under the EAA.

1.  **Create an Accessibility Statement**

The EAA requires businesses to publish accessibility statements on their websites, outlining how their products or services meet the required standards. These statements should include:

1.  Information about the product or service's accessibility features
2.  Contact details for feedback and support
3.  Compliance declarations

This statement should be easily accessible to users and updated regularly.

1.  **Perform an Accessibility Audit**

An accessibility audit is essential to identify existing gaps in compliance. Use automated tools, like Sitefig, to scan your website and digital platforms for broken links, accessibility barriers, and areas of non-compliance. This audit should assess everything from website navigation to content structure and multimedia compatibility.

1.  **Remediate all accessibility issues**

Act on your audit's findings by fixing any accessibility gaps. Addressing these issues, whether broken links, missing alt text, or design flaws, is critical to achieving full compliance and ensuring a seamless user experience for all.

### Timelines for Compliance

1.  **2019**: The EAA was officially adopted by the EU.
2.  **June 28, 2022**: Member states were required to implement the directive into national law.
3.  **June 28, 2025**: Full compliance is mandatory for businesses across the EU.

As of June 2025, all newly marketed products and services must comply with the EAA's accessibility standards. Businesses should start preparing immediately to avoid a last-minute scramble.

### What Are the Penalties for Non-Compliance?

The consequences of failing to meet the EAA's requirements go beyond financial penalties. Here's what your business stands to lose:

1.  **Fines**: Non-compliance can result in substantial financial penalties, ranging from tens of thousands to millions of euros, depending on the jurisdiction and the severity of the breach.
2.  **Legal actions**: Consumers and advocacy groups can take legal action against companies that fail to meet accessibility standards, potentially leading to court cases and reputational damage.
3.  **Loss of contracts**: Inaccessible products and services may be excluded from public procurement and private contracts, leading to a loss of business opportunities.
4.  **Reputational damage**: Companies that fail to prioritize accessibility risk losing customer trust and loyalty.
